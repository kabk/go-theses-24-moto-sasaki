					<p>
						Any object is completely still or in motion from one place to another. Rearranging objects in
						one's apartment is one example, where the objects I am surrounded with are tentative regarding
						the placement.
					</p>

					<p>
						The scene I saw of personal belongings, used as a form of queuing at the football stadium in
						Japan, has a specific reason behind the placement. Although temporarily placed, it has a meaning
						moving forward.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this thesis, I aim to discuss the change in spatial environments caused by the placement of
						objects. My research question is, how does the placement of objects define new interpretations
						within the spatial environment?
						Additionally, what are the implications of misplacing text and objects together?

					</p>
					<p>
						I plan to investigate these aspects by incorporating my memories of visits to a specific spatial
						environment where objects are influenced and exploring examples from contemporary artists that I
						have personally encountered. Throughout this essay, I will dive into some of the chosen works
						mentioned and analyze how the placement of the objects influences the viewer within the space.

					<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

					<p>
						During my time in Japan, every once in a while I enjoyed watching a football match at the
						stadium. At first, it wasn’t in my interest at all. I was aware but not interested. But then it
						became recurring to my eyes whenever I walked past it. As I kept walking around the Todoroki
						stadium, what captivated my attention were the personal belongings on the floor, unsure of why
						there were so many of them. I started to recognize that the personal belongings on the floor
						were a form of queuing that had been agreed upon.
					</p>

					<p>
						Once I realized fans were using personal belongings as a way to claim a place in the queue, this
						sparked an interest.
					</p>

					<p>
						These thoughtless, yet expressive gestures inspired my interest to explore the connection
						between the image of personal belongings as a form of queueing and the art pieces. The focal
						point between the two is the spatial positionings of the objects.

					<h1 id="chapter-1">Personal Belongings on the Floor</h1>

					<p>
						I realized there was a first-come-first-served system<sup>1</sup> for the queue created by
						football fans in Japan. Like an invisible hologram being placed, people were ‘queuing’ through
						their objects. For the annual tennis event for Wimbledon, there is a booklet of guidelines for
						the queue. In the booklet, it’s written that “Temporary absence from the queue of refreshments
						should not exceed 30 minutes.”.<sup>2</sup>
					</p>


					<figcaption>></figcaption>

					<figcaption>[Fig.01,on the right] Personal belongings, Todoroki Stadium, (2019), image captured by
						me</figcaption>

					<p>
						In line with this guideline, I was curious to see whether my spot would be kept. I experimented
						by placing my bottle with my initials, “M” on the bottle to reserve my spot in the queue. I went
						away for a few hours to walk around the neighborhood. Some determined fans would reserve the
						spot earlier than I did, three days before the football match. The reason is, to have a higher
						chance of claiming a good seat at the stadium. I approached my spot and realized my bottle was
						in the same place. As the match was about to start, people returned and lined up according to
						their belongings and then physically queued before the game. There is a sense of environmental
						trust between the community and a daily ritual of placing personal belongings before every
						event.
					</p>

					<p>
						However, people waiting in line can also be seen as a form design, as Don Norman states,
					</p>

					<blockquote>“In that way, it’s a matter of design, of trying to understand the psychology of the
						people waiting but also their boredom and frustration. It requires a human-centered design
						perspective, from the points of view of both the people doing the servicing and the people
						waiting in line. That isn’t hard, but you have to develop a sensitivity to it or realize why it
						might be important.”<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

					<p>
						The placing of the bottles completely diminishes the frustration and boredom that people may
						feel while queueing. The system of placing one's belongings and returning when they need to,
						allows the individuals to make use of their time efficiently.

					<h1 id="chapter-2">An Imaginary Methodology </h1>

					<p>
						Augmented reality is an experience of combining digital information and the real world as a form
						of additional input for users by altering their natural environment through
						technology.<sup>4</sup>
					</p>

					<p>
						In 2017, IKEA released the ‘IKEA Place’ app to help people virtually place furniture in their
						homes.<sup>5</sup> Through a sense of augmented reality, users can place interiors in their
						rooms
						and experiment with the interiors that would suit the space. This makes shopping for furniture
						much more convenient while in the comfort of their home.

					<figcaption>[Fig.03] IKEA, IKEA Place, 2017</figcaption>

					<p>
						This made me wonder whether we can see a future where augmented reality can replace queueing?
						The action of placing personal belongings on the floor for a queue creates an augmented
						reality-like aspect of being present in absence. So the users have the luxury of not waiting?
					</p>



					<p>
						Let's say the user creates an AR avatar. As I am writing, I recall something familiar. Back when
						I was a teenager, occasionally, I would play Nintendo Wii. There is an option in the console for
						users to create a personal Mii. A Mii is a customizable avatar used in Nintendo
						consoles.<sup>6</sup> What if a personal Mii is on the spot in the queue?
					</p>

					<figcaption>></figcaption>

					<figcaption>[Fig.04, on the right] Mii, Nintendo</figcaption>

					<p>
						A digital personal avatar is in the queue rather than the person. He or she applies the avatar
						just like one does using IKEA Place, from their own home and then views the avatar using
						augmented reality in the dedicated area in the queue. Once they are in the queue. An augmented
						reality Mii is waiting in line. I created an imaginary scenario of Mii with the queue but it
						does sound promising.
					</p>

					<p>
						The methodology of the personal belongings with the queue is eye-opening due to the uniqueness
						of the action. Placing your belongings on the floor at the stadium unattended is possible to
						proceed, amongst these individuals because it is agreed upon with mutual trust.
					</p>

					<p>
						Each personal belongings created a communal art installation.

					<p>
						Zhanna Kadyrova's installation, "Filling In" (2012), featuring cups, pans, jugs, and buckets,
						came to my mind
					</p>


					<p>
						There is a similarity between the image of the personal belongings on the floor and Kadyrova's
						“Filling In” artwork. Both involve the placement of household items with the same principle— an
						intention towards the placement.

					</p>



					<p>
						In the work of “Filling in” a sense of urgency of leaning towards the pans and cups is present.
						To look closer to the artwork; Colorful tiles are filled rather than a transparent liquid in
						each of the household items. The color here presents a tension between the form and the
						signifier. The liquid in each has an association with food or beverage. For example, the white
						could signify milk, the red could signify strawberry jam, the blue could signify? And the black
						could signify? Am I able to drink from the blue container?
					</p>

					<p>
						The work challenges the audience to contemplate a deep feeling about what we choose to fill the
						containers with and what we consume from them in our everyday lives.<sup>7</sup> It is almost
						unrecognizable to identify the placement of the color and the household items together because
						it brings the viewer to reconsider what we choose to fill the containers with.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sometimes one has to physically attend a room, place, or exhibition to notice how a sculpture,
						artwork, or object is changing the viewer's senses.

					<p>
						While attending the exhibition of Anthony Gormley, the piece ‘Breathing Room III’ (2010)
						caught
						my attention. As shown in Figure 6, the space contains a three-dimensional drawing of
						lines. The
						photo-luminescent paint on the three-dimensional lines produces light when it is dark.
						In my
						perception, the work seemed to challenge the audience's sensory perception and how the
						work
						created a sense of surprise and wonder. I decided to observe the bright blue light in
						the dark
						room. People were walking around and discussing as they walked. I was waiting and
						observing. I
						could only see the shadows of the human body moving. Across the room, I hear people
						talking. All
						of a sudden, the people stopped talking. Immediately, I stopped thinking. The quick
						transition
						from dark to light, the immediate reveal of the human existence from the shadow to the
						visibility of their outfits and their faces caught me off guard. The light turned off in
						the
						room and I was back to seeing the shadow of the human body moving.
					</p>

					<p>
						Anthony Gromley says about the Breathing Room III (2010),
					</p>

					<blockquote>

						“The dynamic of the breathing room is between meditation and integration, this is not
						about
						representation, this is not about transferring information or ideas, it is reinforcing
						the
						first-hand experience of each and every one of us, as experiencing consciousness within
						these
						spaces. And that it should be both reinforcing but also disorienting”<sup>8</sup>

					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Although the artist himself suggests that it is not a representation. As an observer, I
						see the
						space of the Breathing Room III (2010) as an infinite representation of the everyday
						lifestyle
						of people walking through day and night. On a sunny day outside, we can see their
						outfits and
						their facial expressions, while at night outside we can see shadows of people moving
						unless
						there is a light nearby. One last note: the rapid transition of the dark and the light
						within
						the space creates the feeling of disorientation.
					</p>

					<p>
						I once visited a store that sells clocks. This place created a similar experience. I
						entered
						with an open curiosity to see different kinds of clocks. In the room, I see different
						types of
						clocks. I noticed that the clocks were moving at different tempos. I couldn’t think at
						the
						moment. I had my eye on one clock but there were other clocks ticking and other clocks
						ticking
						at a different pace. I was lost in a room surrounded by clocks. I couldn’t stay any
						longer. I
						asked myself, how am I able to spend a day with a ticking sound that is not
						synchronized? Since
						then I haven’t been to the shop again. The spatial environment surrounded by clocks made
						me feel
						disoriented.
					</p>

					<p>
						Referring back to Anthony Gromley’s work, Breathing Room III (2010), This experience
						stands in
						contrast to my visit to the clock store. In the case of the clock store, the sound was
						the focus
						of the disorientation within the spatial environment whereas in the Breathing Room, the
						act of
						switching the light on and off was causing disorientation.

					<p>
						For my visual essay, I decided to produce a video rather than create a collection of images in a
						book form. I decided to lay out the images and print out words on top of a lightbox. (words
						mentioned in the video are chosen intuitively and printed before recording).
					</p>

					<p>
						I wanted to communicate the process of choosing, making a decision, and creating a dialogue with
						the images and the words together. There isn’t a straightforward correlation between the words
						and the images but placing the words below the images produces an open dialogue to the viewer or
						even a variety of associations.
					</p>

					<p>
						The part where it is blank is where I was thinking. In my mind, I was thinking to myself, what
						images should I place? or what words should I place? or should I place the images and words
						together to see whether they match?

					<h1 id="chapter-4">Objects and Schema </h1>

					<p>
						As I started to read about the concept of schema, I found the work of “Thinking Head” by Lara
						Favaretto clashes with it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Schema is a foundation that we can use to take in new information and try to search whether it
						makes any sense. The way our brain can organize information in our minds is like a filing
						cabinet.<sup>9</sup>
					</p>


					<p>
						Object schemas allow our brains to categorize inanimate objects without any thoughts behind
						them, for example, one can understand how to use a pencil and eraser.
					</p>

					<figcaption>[Fig.08] Lara Favaretto, Thinking Head, (2019), image captured by me </figcaption>

					<p>
						I decided to visit the Biennale in Venice and saw Lara Favaretto's work, "Thinking Head" (2019).
						The objects and words were strategically placed, creating new meanings from a different
						perspective.
					</p>

					<p>
						The words were chosen by selected participants from which the artist decided. The words were
						debated and discussed in a bunker. Later those keywords are combined with the corresponding
						objects.
					</p>

					<p>
						Schema comes along in the discussion of this chapter because when I perceive the objects, the
						first impression of each object and each word is implemented straight to the mind. This is
						because the art piece and words combined with the artwork may not seem to be related at first
						glance. However, as you read the word, it builds a more diverse perspective, in such a way that
						the word and the object intertwine and have an open dialogue behind them.

					<p>
						I was in the room searching for a connection. The relationship between the words and objects
						wasn’t aligning, which changed my interpretation, therefore I had to refine my understanding of
						the piece. In the work, the intention of the placement behind the provisional aspect in the
						objects and the words is to imitate the subdivision of the mind, the thought process, or the
						memory.

						In line with the scene at the football stadium, the bottle belongs to somebody hence the
						initials of the individual. There is a significant connection and belonging but what I find
						intriguing is that although an obvious connection exists, the text (initials) becomes detached
						from the object (personal belongings). Each individual has a direct implication of the
						connection because of their initials applying to the bottle. But as an observer, it has a
						misplacement but also assumes that the object and the initials connect.
					</p>

					<p>
						In that way, Favaretto’s work and the bottle with the initials have a resemblance.

					<p>
						The placement of the object manipulates the viewer not only in an exhibition space or public
						space but also creates new meaning in television. Although subtle and unnoticeable for the
						audience to sometimes recognize. The placement of the product placement<sup>10</sup> in
						television has a strong attraction for marketing.
					</p>

					<p>
						One example that significantly raised the viewer's attention is the product placement of
						eggo<sup>11</sup> in the TV series, Stranger Things (2016).
					</p>

					<p>
						While watching the TV series, there was an appearance of Eggo waffles, in this particular scene,
						shown in figure 11. Not only does the placement of the product influence the viewer's attention
						but it also saw an increase in the rise of consumption of the frozen waffle
						industry.<sup>12</sup>
					</p>


					<!-- <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-13"
						href="#fn-13">13</a> -->

					<p>
						The website ‘Product Placement Blog’<sup>13</sup> has a record of other products that have
						appeared in the TV show, Stranger Things (2016). The website also shows products that have
						appeared in other movies and TV shows.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this case, these products that appeared in the television show shaped a sense of the 1980s
						atmosphere within the set design. This example shows the subtle importance of placing in a set
						design. Similar to what was seen in the artworks and the placement of the personal belongings on
						the queue, this conveys the significance of specific placements of objects in various domains.

					<p>
						To write this thesis, with the research question: how does the placement of the object define
						new interpretations within the spatial environment? primarily highlighting the personal
						belongings on the floor, has opened up topics that I would have not touched upon. One topic that
						surprised me, was product placement in television. An area in which I would like to pay more
						attention when watching movies or TV shows. The placement has an intention, just as the
						placement of objects in the queue has a deliberate intention. Although subtle.
					</p>
